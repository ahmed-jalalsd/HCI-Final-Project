# HCI-Final-Project
Human Computer Interaction Final project Tabi travel application for the Master of Engineering in Computer Science 

This project was presented as final project for HCI course

# Tools was used
1-Mock-up -> Balsamiq.

2-Low-fi prototype -> Balsamiq.

3-Medium-fi prototype -> Adobe XD.

4-High-fi prototype -> Adobe XD.

5-Final product -> Ionic 4 framework.

# Design Process Design Process
# Overview
The Design process was taken in various steps and phases, the first one was the requirements gathering and analysis 
which also is divided into two parts, users and competition analysis.
The user requirements analysis was carried out by the mean of interviews, the interviewees asked a curated list of questions.
Through these interviews we created a persona and a scenario.
Competitor analysis is an assessment of weaknesses and strengths of current and potential competitors, and to identify 
whether there is even a market for your idea if so, what that market looks like.
The next stage was the hierarchical task analysis that enables UX designers during UX development process. 
To quickly understand both what a system does and how its capabilities translate into the system’s user experience.
After that is State transition networks stage, which helps to understand the proposed design better and formal representation 
makes it possible to analyse dialogs to identify usability problems (e.g., we can answer questions such as “does the design 
actually support undo”?).
After these stages the journey of designing the app started, with the Mock-up & Low-fi Prototype stage. The tool that
has been used to develop the product was Balsamiq.
The next stage is the experience evaluation or Heuristic Evaluation Low-FI, based on Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics.
Using the feedback from the previous stage, the design was updated in the Medium-fi Prototype stage, the following 
stage is the real user evaluation.
Think aloud was used in this stage, in similar way the feedback from this stage was used to develop the Final product.
